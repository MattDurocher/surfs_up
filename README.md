# surfs_up
## Overview
For this project, we were helping W. Avy get some information on temperature trends so that the surf shop can be opened. We were looking to combine a surf shop and an ice cream shop into one business. This is a great idea since Hawaii is a warm area year round, but we wanted to know exactly how warm it was before we could greenlight the project. Our results found a wide range of data on each month that allowed us to make an informed decision on whether or not we are going to open the shop.
## Results
There are three differences between the weather in June and December. They are:
- June has a higher mean temperature than December
- June has a higher maximum temperature than December
- December has a lower minimum temperature than Jun
## Summary
Our results have shown that the Temperatures generally do not change all that much from the summer to the winter. That is good to know since the business is going to revolve around people doing activities that are more enjoyable with good weather. Now that we are ready to open the shop, we need to focus on two things that will help us with staffing. Weather in the fall and spring, and how often it rains in each of these four seasons. While it is important for the shop to be open year round, we want to find exactly when the temperatures will dip down and up again. There will be a "season" so knowing exactly when that season starts and ends will help us know how many employees we need to hire. In order to do this, we will have to get data for each month. Keeping track of the rain will also be important. If certain months are heavy on rain, there won't be as much action on the waves due to the danger and less customers for ice cream since they will want to stay indoors. Luckily for us, there aren't any other types of weather effects on Hawaii. By keeping track of these two things, we will be able to run the most successful shop on the island.
